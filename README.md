# characteristic-p-models

In my 2024 "Integers" paper, I proposed conjectures about finite-field polynomial models 
of the Fourier coefficients of Hecke modular forms. Here I will store SageMath notebooks
and text data files for calculations studying possible models of the same objects, but lying in the 
algebraic closure of infinite sets of finite fields.
